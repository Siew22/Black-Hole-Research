This repository contains the source code for the research project, "Teaching AI to See the Unseen," a comprehensive AI framework designed for the multimodal characterization of astrophysical phenomena. The system leverages a novel Hierarchical Fusion Model (HFM) to effectively integrate data from five distinct modalities, addressing challenges like signal dominance and data scarcity in modern astrophysics.

## Core Features

* **Five-Modality Data Processing**: Processing images, tables, gravitational waves, X-rays, and volume data.

* **Hierarchical Fusion Model (HFM)**: An innovative fusion architecture that addresses the "signal dominance" problem through weak modal pre-fusion.

* **End-to-End Research Framework**: Covering the entire process from data generation, feature extraction, model fusion, hyperparameter search to final evaluation.

* **Generative Data Augmentation**: Built-in a multimodal conditional GAN ​​for synthesizing new, high-fidelity paired data.

* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Use SHAP and Grad-CAM to deeply understand and explain the model's decision-making process.
* **Online Learning & Anomaly Detection**: Simulate real data streams to achieve active learning, continuous updating, and abnormal event detection of models.

## Installation & Setup

This project runs in a Linux environment (tested with WSL 2) with an NVIDIA GPU.

### 1. Prerequisites

* NVIDIA graphics driver
* CUDA Toolkit (Recommended version 12.x)
* cuDNN

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Black-hole-reseach.git
cd Black-hole-reseach
Use code with caution.
(Please replace YourUsername with your GitHub username)
3. Create and activate a virtual environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
Generated bash
# Create a virtual environment (for example, using venv)
python -m venv env

# Activate a virtual environment
# Linux / WSL
source env/bin/activate
# Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate
Use code with caution.
Bash
4. Install dependencies
All required Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
This will automatically install all the required libraries such as TensorFlow, SHAP, W&B, etc.
5. (Optional) Configure Weights & Biases
This project uses W&B for experiment tracking. You need to log in to your W&B account.
Generated bash
wandb login
Use code with caution.
Bash
Then, please modify WANDB_PROJECT and WANDB_ENTITY in the config.py file to your own project name and entity name.
How to Run
The entire research process can be started by running the main script main.py.
Generated bash
python main.py
Use code with caution.

Bash
Configuration File (config.py)
You can adjust various parameters in config.py to control the experiment process, for example:
run_gan_demo: whether to run the long GAN training part (set to True or False).
run_hp_tuning: whether to run hyperparameter search.
NUM_INITIAL_SAMPLES: size of the dataset generated initially.
INITIAL_TRAINING_EPOCHS: number of epochs for initial training.
Result Highlights
Our framework successfully demonstrates the superiority of multimodal fusion in astrophysical event classification.
1. Single modality vs multimodality
Experiments show that while some single modalities (such as X-rays) perform well, other modalities (such as gravitational waves) have ambiguous information. Our HFM fusion model demonstrates robust generalization on an independent holdout test set and significantly improves the recognition of rare categories.
(You can put a comparison chart here, such as the confusion matrix of a single modality vs the confusion matrix of the final fusion model)

2. Explainability Analysis (XAI)
Through SHAP and Grad-CAM, we were able to "open" the black box of the model.
SHAP analysis: quantitatively shows that image and time series features are the main contributors to the classification task, proving that the model is indeed performing cross-modal learning.
Grad-CAM analysis: intuitively shows that the model focuses on the most physically relevant areas (such as the center of a black hole or the bright core of a formation event) when performing image classification.

3. Generative Model
Our multimodal GAN ​​successfully learned the data distribution and can generate new data samples with physical consistency, demonstrating its great potential as a data augmentation tool.

Conclusion and future work
This project successfully built and verified a multimodal AI framework for astrophysical event analysis. The results show that the hierarchical fusion strategy can effectively integrate heterogeneous data and improve model performance and interpretability.
Future work will focus on:
Applying the framework to real observational data.
Exploring more advanced attention mechanisms and loss functions.
Introducing physical prior knowledge to constrain the model (Physics-Informed AI).
